 * Red-black tree has the following 5 properties:
 * (1) Every node is either red or black.
 * (2) The root is black.
 * (3) Every leaf (NULL) is black.
 * (4) If a node is red, then both its children are black.
 * (5) For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.
