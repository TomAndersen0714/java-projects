/**
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methodreferences.html
 * You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however, a lambda expression
 * does nothing but call an existing method. In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the
 * existing method by name. 'Method references' enable you to do this; they are compact,
 * easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.
