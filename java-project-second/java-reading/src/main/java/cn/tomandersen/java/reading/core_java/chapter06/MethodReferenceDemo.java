/**
 * Method reference is a kind of syntactic sugar to simplify lambda expression.
 * <p>
 * You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however,
 * a lambda expression does nothing but call an existing method.
 * In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method by name.
 * Method references enable you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read
 * lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.
